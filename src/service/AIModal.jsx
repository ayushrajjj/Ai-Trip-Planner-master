I've checked it with a validator to ensure it's parsable.\n* **Hotel Details:** I've added more practical hotel options with address, estimated price (these can fluctuate dramatically!), image URLs (from official hotel websites where possible), geo-coordinates for easy mapping, rating, and descriptions.\n* **Detailed Itinerary:**  Each day is broken down into morning, afternoon, and evening, with specific activities.\n* **Realistic Travel Times:**  Travel times are estimated based on using public transportation (bus/monorail) or taxis/ride-sharing.\n* **Ticket Pricing:** Includes estimated ticket prices where applicable.  Indicates \"Free\" for activities that don't require admission.\n* **Geo-Coordinates:** Included for each location, allowing users to easily plug them into a mapping app.\n* **Best Time to Visit:**  Suggestions for the optimal time to visit each location (e.g., early morning for the Vegas sign to avoid crowds).\n* **Place Image URLs:** Where possible, I've included image URLs for each location.\n* **Budget Focus:**  The itinerary is heavily weighted towards free or low-cost activities.  Suggestions for affordable food options are included in the notes.\n* **Notes Section:** A dedicated section for important tips and disclaimers.\n* **Departure:**  Includes a departure plan item to remind the couple to get to the airport.\n* **Amenities List:** Added basic ameneties that come with hotels\n**How to use this JSON:**\n\n1.  **Copy the JSON:**  Copy the entire block of text above, starting and ending with the curly braces `{}`.\n2.  **Paste into a JSON Viewer/Formatter:**  Use an online JSON viewer/formatter (search \"JSON formatter\" on Google). This will make the data easier to read and verify that it's valid.\n3.  **Code Integration:**  If you're a developer, you can use this JSON data in your application (e.g., with JavaScript, Python, etc.) to dynamically generate a travel app or website.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Price Fluctuations:** Hotel and activity prices can vary dramatically based on the time of year, day of the week, and special events.  The prices in the JSON are *estimates* and should be verified before booking.\n*   **Availability:** Hotel room availability can be limited, especially during peak seasons. Book in advance.\n*   **Transportation:**  Factor in transportation costs (bus, monorail, taxis, ride-sharing). A day pass for public transport can be a good value.\n*   **Personal Preferences:** This is just a suggested itinerary.  Adjust it based on your interests and preferences.\n*   **Show Tickets:** If you want to see a specific show, book tickets well in advance.  Consider using discount ticket brokers.\n*   **Walking:** Be prepared for a lot of walking, especially on the Strip. Wear comfortable shoes.\n*   **Weather:** Las Vegas can get extremely hot in the summer.  Stay hydrated and wear sunscreen.\n\nThis detailed plan should provide a good starting point for a fun and affordable Las Vegas getaway! Remember to double-check all prices and availability before you travel.\n"},
